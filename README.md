I'm a freshman at the UW majoring in computer science.
Some things you should know about me are that I love playing games like VALORANT, League of Legends, and Osu! If you play any of these, don't hesitate to hmu and we can play together!
Additionally, I'm looking for a group of motivated coders to work on a serious project during the summer (2022) in software or game development. 
Although I am still a beginner, I am excited and inspired to learn what is necessary to succeed in those fields!
